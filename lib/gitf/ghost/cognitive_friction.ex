  Dynamic cognitive friction for ghosts.

  Adjusts how much a ghost must "think before acting" based on op risk level.
  High-risk ops get mandatory confirmation prompts; low-risk ops get
  streamlined instructions with no extra friction.

  @doc """
  Returns extra priming instructions based on risk level.

  Appended to the ghost's Rules section during priming so the ghost
  adjusts its behaviour to match the risk of the op.
