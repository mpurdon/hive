defmodule GiTF.Runtime.MultiObjectiveSelector do
  @moduledoc """
  Multi-objective model selector that balances quality, cost, and budget.

  Replaces simple budget-downgrade logic with a weighted scoring system:
  - Quality score (weight 0.5): from model reputation success_rate
  - Cost score (weight 0.3): inverted cost tier (haiku cheapest)
  - Budget score (weight 0.2): penalizes expensive models when budget is low

  Risk adjustment shifts weight from cost to quality for high/critical ops.
