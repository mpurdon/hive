  Tracks merge attempt outcomes to inform future merge strategy decisions.

  Records are stored in the `:merge_history` Store collection. Each record
  captures which tier was attempted, whether it succeeded, and which files
  were involved. This data drives the tier-skipping heuristic: if a tier
  has failed 2+ times for a set of files with 0 successes, skip it.
