  Dynamic cognitive friction for bees.

  Adjusts how much a bee must "think before acting" based on job risk level.
  High-risk jobs get mandatory confirmation prompts; low-risk jobs get
  streamlined instructions with no extra friction.

  @doc """
  Returns extra priming instructions based on risk level.

  Appended to the bee's Rules section during priming so the bee
  adjusts its behaviour to match the risk of the job.
